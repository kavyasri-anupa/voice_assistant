# voice_assistant
want to make your own voice assistant?It is damn easy with python. In voice_control file I have imported some files which includes sending  message through whatsapp by using selenium (you can find the code in whatsapp_with_python) ,send mail using SMTP library or you can also use selenium (you can find the code in send_mail),by using beautiful soup library (for webscrapping) to collect news headlines from inshorts and send those headlines to your whatsapp(code is in news headlines file) ,play your favourite video in youtube(you can find code in youtube file) and listen to your fav song (in music file I used jio saavan ,you can choose your own music website, but keep in mind that HTML elements varies) and events file helps you to store all the events and corresponding dates in case you have a short memory it helps you a lot by storing birthdays,anniversaries and other events( code is in events file.It compares the list you have created with today's date and gives the output).
All these executes with your commands .But,QR scanning should be done manually to send msg through whatsapp.
